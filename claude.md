At the end of this message, I will ask you to do something. Please follow the "Explore, Plan, Code, Test" workflow when you start.

Explore
First, use parallel subagents to find and read all files that may be useful for implementing the ticket, either as examples or as edit targets. The subagents should return relevant file paths, and any other info that may be useful.

Plan
Next, think hard and write up a detailed implementation plan. Don't forget to include tests, lookbook components, and documentation. Use your judgement as to what is necessary, given the standards of this repo.

If there are things you are not sure about, use parallel subagents to do some web research. They should only return useful information, no noise.

If there are things you still do not understand or questions you have for the user, pause here to ask them before continuing.

Code
When you have a thorough implementation plan, you are ready to start writing code. Follow the style of the existing codebase (e.g. we prefer clearly named variables and methods to extensive comments). Make sure to run our autoformatting script when you're done, and fix linter warnings that seem reasonable to you.

Test
Use parallel subagents to run tests, and make sure they all pass.

If your changes touch the UX in a major way, use the browser to make sure that everything works correctly. Make a list of what to test for, and use a subagent for this step.

If your testing shows problems, go back to the planning stage and think ultrahard.

Write up your work
When you are happy with your work, write up a short report that could be used as the PR description. Include what you set out to do, the choices you made with their brief justification, and any commands you ran in the process that may be useful for future developers to know about.

Appliction Purpose: Purpose of this application:  Please note, here the application youre building is that drives traffic, builds an audience, and establishes a distribution network for a future data, AI, and analytics SaaS and consulting company. So I want to include as much as resources as possible on the website and make it slick and look cool to gain more traction once the user is in the UI. they  could use the open source projects or the applications that I have built or the blogs that I have wrote and see the marketplace that's been within the application to retain the user and convert it to a lead once I start the company.

Tasks: 
1. Remove these 3d animations and smooth slicing all fancy stuff from Blog Page completely it should be simple, fast, clean.

## Current Website Structure

The landing page now features the following sections with 3D mountain themes and animations:

**Main Sections:**
- Services
- Resources  
- Blog
- About
- Join Newsletter

**3D Enhancements Implemented:**
1. **Mountain Environments**: All sections now feature CSS-based 3D mountain backgrounds with:
   - Layered mountain silhouettes with snow caps
   - Animated snow particles (snowfall and blizzard effects)
   - Atmospheric cloud effects
   - Parallax scrolling effects

2. **Technology Logos Integration**: PowerBI, Snowflake, Databricks, AI/ML, and Microsoft Fabric icons are now prominently displayed throughout the site with:
   - Floating tech showcases in hero section
   - Compact tech displays in service sections
   - 3D-style animations and glassmorphism effects

**Technical Implementation:**
- Replaced React Three Fiber Canvas components with CSS-based alternatives to resolve compatibility issues
- All 3D effects now use pure CSS animations and transforms
- Enhanced with backdrop-blur and glassmorphism styling
- Maintained visual consistency across all sections

**Removed Sections:**
- Technology Deep Dives (ProductsSection) - Removed old 2D section
- Success Stories (CaseStudiesSection) - Removed old 2D section
- Updated header navigation to reflect current sections only

Memories:
- Added initial memory about the application's purpose and technical implementation details
- Added context about missing UI elements and desired 3D enhancements for the landing page
